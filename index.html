            <h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
            My name is Daniel, I am 29 years old.<br/>
      I am currently living and working out of Canberra ACT. 
      <br/>I grew up in the Central West of New South Wales. Growing up I rode motorcross, played rugby and had many pets. My heritage is a mix of English and Scotish. One of the hobies I liked to do was caving.
    
      <h2 style="text-align:center;">My interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started as early as 9 years old. I can remember in 1999, my father bought home a computer running windows 95. It came with all standard programs and nothing else, at that age it was not an issue. I recall being very excited to be able to power it up and lose countless hours to Microsoft Paint, Microsoft Word and Freecell. We of course did not have internet access at the time, which meant my curiosity led me to explore every menu I could find. This led me to learning how to interact with such things as command prompt and device manager  </p>
      
      <p>One moment that I can remember sparking my interest in IT was going to work with dad and observing his colleagues using computers with a variety of different programs that I had never seen. Shortly after, I was shown how a search engine worked which led me to a never-ending supply of information that has me hooked to this day. I often find myself searching online for reviews of products before I buy them, fact checking when I find it difficult to believe what someone has said or researching for new information.  </p>
      
    <p>All this aside, my formal IT experience is limited. While I have had to use different technology in various jobs, it has never been specific to IT itself. Informally, I have pieced together gaming computers – including extensive research leading to the purchasing of each element, set up home networks for myself, friends and family, and generally have a better understanding of the physical computer system then most in my life. I am the member of family that gets the call whenever IT goes wrong.  </p>
      
      <p>When deciding that I wanted to pursue formal study and a career in IT, I started to look into different courses, from a Cert II in IT, right up to Bachelor's degrees. I ended up choosing RMIT as a suggestion from my parter, who works in Secondary Education. She found the course and we decided it was a good choice for me, as it allowed me to do the first two units of the degree as pre-requisite to get into the course. It also allowed me to complete the course online, as I work full time and live outside of Melbourne, this was essential. When I further looked into RMIT,  </p>
      
      <p>By studying at RMIT, I expect to gain a greater understanding of IT. First, I need to fully understand all avenues that ‘IT’ incorporates, next I hope to gather a greater understanding of coding, IT Security, networking and other disciplines, and finally, I hope to gain the knowledge I need to seek employment as a successful graduate.  </p>
      
      
      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Information Security Specialist</h2>

        <p>Searching through the IT jobs I find myself looking into any job mentioning “security”. In recent years through the media I have heard of cyber-attacks, in particular, the WannaCry ransomware attack that corrupted peoples computers, locking them out and forcing ransom payments through bitcoin (Fruhlinger, 2020). Earlier this year Toll Group was crippled by a cyber-attack, leaving many concerned with their personal information, and forcing the logistics company to shut down many of the IT systems (Crozier, 2020). At a more personal level, my own mother was recently at the hands of scammers, as she unknowingly allowed remote access to her computer in an attempt to force her to pay them to have it recovered. I want to be a part of protection against these threats, to be a part of the solution.  </p>
            
      
      
      <p>The position of <a href="idealjob.html">Information Security Specialist</a> (See appendix 1) requires the candidate to have a tertiary education in Information Technology, with multiple certifications relating to Cisco CCNP, ethical Hacking and large data network environments (n.a. 2020). Along with this a broad knowledge of enterprise security solutions, an understanding of several programming languages and knowledge of cloud-based services. Ultimately, Information Security Specialists are hired to work with organizations to assist with creating disaster recovery plans and carry out security measures to protect the company's network and systems (“Misdegree”, 2020). You also need to be up to date with the current threats and vulnerabilities in the IT sector (n.a. 2020). </p>
      
      <p>I currently do not possess any of the qualifications for this job. Skills that I have are an attention to detail, clear communication, patience and willingness to research to find solutions. As I consistently help my aging parents with their technology problems, I have developed excellent skills in explaining with great detail and in layman's terms. To get to a job such as this, my plan begins by undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. During my time studying, I am hoping to change my career into the Australian Public Service in an IT job, such as IT assistant and IT support. Through this I expect to acquire a solid foundation. Eventually building towards the specific field of cyber security.  </p>
      
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Personal Profile</h2>
            
      <p>16personalities is an online personality test that claims to provide you with “a ‘freakishly-accurate’ description of who you are” ("16Personalities", 2020). I chose to do this test because of its detailed framework and evidence of clear research throughout. According to the results of this test (ESTJ-A), some of my traits include being dedicated, strong willed, direct and honest. I agree with the dedicated and strong-willed elements, given I have spent years competing in sports. From representative rugby as a teenager through to 24hr obstacle racing and participating in ultra-marathons as an adult, I have learned that dedication and discipline lead to positive results. Being strong willed I believe is a benefit, as I am confident to stand by my convictions and can persevere through adversity. As for direct and honest, I believe these are also very consistent with my personality, while at times being direct can be difficult for others to process, for the most part it allows me to get my point across in a clear manner.  </p>
      
            <p>The online learning style test by EducationPlanner.org provides context around the way I learn the best, it runs through a series of questions that ask questions about your learning preferences. The results from this test identified me as someone who is a tactile learner. The results say that in order to improve my overall learning, I need to participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving or drawing, as well as completing art projects, taking walks and acting. In some ways, I believe this to be an accurate representation of myself, however, at times to my detriment. This type of learner is also suggested to take frequent breaks, chew gum and fidget – while these are reasonable tasks for a person to complete, they can become a challenge in the workplace as there is limited opportunity for some of these suggestions. However, it also says that tactile learners are good at remembering tasks that they have physically completed, are coordinated and find reasons to ‘tinker’ around. I believe these to be positive traits, in particular, I think that ‘tinkering’ has led me to understanding many useful skills, from mechanic work to building computers and cooking. This is useful in a workplace as I have an increased ability to work things out when they physically breakdown.  </p>
            
            <p>The final test that I completed was the Enneagram test, I chose to do this test as it was something that my partners workplace had them do as professional development and learning how to work within a team, as her school has a strong team-teaching model as part of its philosophy. The test identified me as an ‘eight’, saying that overall, I am motivated by the desire to be independent and to take charge of myself and others ("The Enneagram Personality Test", 2020). It mentions being assertive and passionate about life, approaching tasks with vigor and confidence. Finally, eights possess the qualities of natural leaders, are action people who prefer to ‘do’ and are happy to make difficult decisions and accept when things go wrong ("The Enneagram Personality Test", 2020). I agree with this, as I often find myself making decisions confidently based on my understanding of the situation, I have no problem with sharing these decisions, and can find it frustrating when others are indecisive.  </p>
            
            <p>Overall, these tests have helped me to understand that I am assertive person who is strong willed and likes to feel appreciated in a group setting. These results help me to understand that in a group setting, I may dominate the conversation or be relied on to make tough calls in difficult situations. Being aware of this means that I am more likely to be able to pick up on it when it is happening and challenge myself to consider the way that others may see this. I also believe that these results make me a good team member, as I am committed, strive to do the best I can and am active in finding a solution, specifically in the practical application of tasks. If I was to form a team for myself, I would need to ensure that each member of the team was able to handle directness and honesty about their work. If I discover that they find this challenging, it would be helpful for me to consider the tone in which I speak. It may also be helpful to pair with an auditory and visual learner, to maximize our potential as each person would bring a new perspective to the group.  </p>
    
             <h2 style="text-align:center;">Prouduct Idea</h2>
            
            <p>This project presented will be an ‘opt-in’ data logger for use with insurance companies. It will allow a driver to collect data on an individual's driving style, backed with video evidence and dash cluster information. It will be a black box for your car incorporating dual dash cameras front and rear, and a data reader that will collect information such as distance travelled, speed, hard accelerating/braking and lateral movements. You will use a smart phone to sync to the Blackbox and browse your information, you can then choose to upload it to a cloud where an algorithm will calculate a risk driving score for the month. The lower the driver risk score the lower premiums paid for that month. This device would also be of use in determining who was at fault in an accident.  </p>
            
            <p>With 19.5 million registered vehicles in 2019, it is telling that Australia is a nation of drivers. This product is useful for the low risk drivers in decreasing their insurance premiums and parents of young at-risk drivers, this device is a useful system to monitor an inexperienced driver habit. ("9309.0 - Motor Vehicle Census, Australia, 31 Jan 2019", 2020). With 9 out of 10 Australians owning smart phones in 2019, costs will be minimised, as a large part of the device will rely on the use of a smart phone (Mobile Nation 2019 The 5G future, 2020). A future where vehicles all had a product like this installed would transform our busy roads into a safer place, as people would be more interested in saving money. On top of this, most cars would be video recording everywhere they went, forming a dynamic surveillance system, perhaps encouraging better driving behaviors.  </p>
            
            <p>In 2015, <i> The Daily Telegraph </i> reported that Australians are quickly developing a reputation for being bad drivers, as videos and pictures started to spread around the world. This cannot be said for all Australian drivers and the proposed project allows people to prove their innocence and keep a log of their data to be crowned a ‘good driver’ and be rewarded with lower premiums on their insurance. The proposed allows people to prove that they do not speed or drive erratically. The device would compare the speed on the speedometer of the car, while simultaneously identifying through GPS which road the car was on, and in turn the speed limit, showing that they are within it. As for erratic driving, hard cornering, hard braking, bumps, scraps and aggressive accelerating, this would also be monitored to ensure that drivers are not testing their cars limits and wearing out brake-pads, tyres etc that could compromise the cars ability to help avoid an accident. This is beneficial for insurance companies as they can hold people accountable for their bad driving, as this is opt-in, the insurance companies should have driving scores for each month, with the worst being the same price as what someone without the device would pay. If this device means people will end up paying more for their premiums than without it, it will not work, this is why users would be given the option to send in their data for the month, rather than have insurance companies have access all the time. </p> 
            
            <p>The brains of this would be a Raspberry Pi 4.  
An on-board diagnostics 2 (OBD2) scanner would be plugged into the cars OBD2 port (After 2005 Australian market) which is tethered to the Raspberry Pi 4 via a cable. With OBD2 it allows access to the vehicles computer system (Dube, 2020). It is typically used by a mechanic with an OBD2 scanner when a dash light illuminates. The scanner will output a code that will align with the vehicles fault code. However, this can be continuously monitored to be recorded by such a device as a Raspberry Pi and storage device (Martin, 2020). Data that would be beneficial to record from the OBD2 are throttle position, engine RPM, speed, engine runtime since start and distance. </p> 

<p>To track the car a separate GPS device would need to be attached via USB to the Raspberry Pi ("Adding USB Attached GPS to your Raspberry Pi Projects", 2020). This would make it possible to record the location of the car when it is parked, measure speed again and to have the option of tracking down a stolen car. </p> 

<p>A tri axis accelerometer would be an essential sensor to record any sudden changes in velocity (Fernandez, 2020). This could be the change in velocity if the car is in an accident, hard cornering, hard braking, hitting a bump to hard or aggressive accelerating. </p> 

<p>The Programming language to control all this would be Python. With an abundant community of hobbyists that use Python and Raspberry Pi’s in conjunction with each other, there are many online resources to assist in the troubles of developing a working Telemetry program (Kirk, 2020). </p>

<p> According to News.com (2019), <i>“a car is stolen every 12 minutes</i> in Australia” meaning the likelihood of a well-maintained car to be taken is significant. The proposed project, while being a handy tool for insurers, is also a convenient way to track stolen vehicles with the hope of getting it back in one piece and catching the criminals who stole it. This device would assist police in the significant amount of calls they get each year (55,000 vehicles in 2018/2019 financial year). The device sits in behind the dash of the car, meaning that potential thieves would not be able to easily discard of it. This would also be a handy tool for parents to be able to track their young drivers, ensuring they are driving appropriately (poor kids). </p>

<p> Finally, if you find yourself in the unfortunate event of being in an accident, having a dashcam can help to prove that you are not liable and that the negligence is that of another driver (SteinLaw, 2020). The proposed project includes both a front and rear camera that saves footage to the cloud for storage and recall when required. </p> 

<p> The app itself would be used to control all of these features, from allowing the driver to send their information to the insurance companies that month, to controlling the dashcams and locating the car on a map. Finally, the app would provide you with a detailed summary of your data to help inform you about your own driving habits and outlining the risks you are taking. For example, if you consistently speed, the app may provide you with some statistics and articles around the increased likelihood of crashing due to speed, perhaps it will help our drivers think twice.  </p>

            <p>The proposed project requires a thorough understanding of the programming language Python to develop a program that will have the capability to decipher the variety of data inputs into a compiled data file. To understand the data a graphical user interface is required to clearly observe what is happening. To create a risk score an algorithm needs to be generated analyse variables, and recognise what is high risk and what is low risk driving behavior. Projects incorporating Raspberry Pi’s are popular with individual sensors. It would be a more challenging task to develop a working program incorporating several sensors using the Python language.  </p>
            
            <p>The results of this project being successful would further increase safety on our roads. Starting with the individual driver that has the system installed. With an uptake of such a system there is a potential to change enough everyday driver habits. Rewarding low risk driver’s with cheaper premiums, expediting insurance claims by utilising the on-board telemetry. Recording evidence of at risk driving in the extreme case that can be forwarded to Police. </p>
