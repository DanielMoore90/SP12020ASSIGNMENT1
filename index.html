            <h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
      I am currently living and working out of Canberra ACT. 
      <br/>I grew up in the Central West of New South Wales. Growing up I rode motorcross, played rugby and had many pets. My heritage is a mix of English and Scotish. One of the hobies I liked to do was caving.
    
      <h2 style="text-align:center;">My interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started as early as 9 years old. I can remember in 1999, my father bought home a computer running windows 95. It came with all standard programs and nothing else, at that age it was not an issue. I recall being very excited to be able to power it up and lose countless hours to Microsoft Paint, Microsoft Word and Freecell. We of course did not have internet access at the time, which meant my curiosity led me to explore every menu I could find. This led me to learning how to interact with such things as command prompt and device manager  </p>
      
      <p>One moment that I can remember sparking my interest in IT was going to work with dad and observing his colleagues using computers with a variety of different programs that I had never seen. Shortly after, I was shown how a search engine worked which led me to a never-ending supply of information that has me hooked to this day. I often find myself searching online for reviews of products before I buy them, fact checking when I find it difficult to believe what someone has said or researching for new information.  </p>
      
    <p>All this aside, my formal IT experience is limited. While I have had to use different technology in various jobs, it has never been specific to IT itself. Informally, I have pieced together gaming computers – including extensive research leading to the purchasing of each element, set up home networks for myself, friends and family, and generally have a better understanding of the physical computer system then most in my life. I am the member of family that gets the call whenever IT goes wrong.  </p>
      
      <p>When deciding that I wanted to pursue formal study and a career in IT, I started to look into different courses, from a Cert II in IT, right up to Bachelor's degrees. I ended up choosing RMIT as a suggestion from my parter, who works in Secondary Education. She found the course and we decided it was a good choice for me, as it allowed me to do the first two units of the degree as pre-requisite to get into the course. It also allowed me to complete the course online, as I work full time and live outside of Melbourne, this was essential. When I further looked into RMIT,  </p>
      
      <p>By studying at RMIT, I expect to gain a greater understanding of IT. First, I need to fully understand all avenues that ‘IT’ incorporates, next I hope to gather a greater understanding of coding, IT Security, networking and other disciplines, and finally, I hope to gain the knowledge I need to seek employment as a successful graduate.  </p>
      
      
      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Information Security Specialist</h2>

        <p>Searching through the IT jobs I find myself looking into any job mentioning “security”. In recent years through the media I have heard of cyber-attacks, in particular, the WannaCry ransomware attack that corrupted peoples computers, locking them out and forcing ransom payments through bitcoin (Fruhlinger, 2020). Earlier this year Toll Group was crippled by a cyber-attack, leaving many concerned with their personal information, and forcing the logistics company to shut down many of the IT systems (Crozier, 2020). At a more personal level, my own mother was recently at the hands of scammers, as she unknowingly allowed remote access to her computer in an attempt to force her to pay them to have it recovered. I want to be a part of protection against these threats, to be a part of the solution.  </p>

          <a href=Information Security Specialist Job in Brisbane - SEEK.html</a>
          
          
          
      <p>The position of “information Security Specialist” (See appendix 1) requires the candidate to have a tertiary education in Information Technology, with multiple certifications relating to Cisco CCNP, ethical Hacking and large data network environments (n.a. 2020). Along with this a broad knowledge of enterprise security solutions, an understanding of several programming languages and knowledge of cloud-based services. Ultimately, Information Security Specialists are hired to work with organizations to assist with creating disaster recovery plans and carry out security measures to protect the company's network and systems (“Misdegree”, 2020). You also need to be up to date with the current threats and vulnerabilities in the IT sector (n.a. 2020). </p>
      
      <p>I currently do not possess any of the qualifications for this job. Skills that I have are an attention to detail, clear communication, patience and willingness to research to find solutions. As I consistently help my aging parents with their technology problems, I have developed excellent skills in explaining with great detail and in layman's terms. To get to a job such as this, my plan begins by undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. During my time studying, I am hoping to change my career into the Australian Public Service in an IT job, such as IT assistant and IT support. Through this I expect to acquire a solid foundation. Eventually building towards the specific field of cyber security.  </p>
      
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Personal Profile</h2>
            
      <p>16personalities is an online personality test that claims to provide you with “a ‘freakishly-accurate’ description of who you are” ("16Personalities", 2020). I chose to do this test because of its detailed framework and evidence of clear research throughout. According to the results of this test (ESTJ-A), some of my traits include being dedicated, strong willed, direct and honest. I agree with the dedicated and strong-willed elements, given I have spent years competing in sports. From representative rugby as a teenager through to 24hr obstacle racing and participating in ultra-marathons as an adult, I have learned that dedication and discipline lead to positive results. Being strong willed I believe is a benefit, as I am confident to stand by my convictions and can persevere through adversity. As for direct and honest, I believe these are also very consistent with my personality, while at times being direct can be difficult for others to process, for the most part it allows me to get my point across in a clear manner.  </p>
      
            <p>The online learning style test by EducationPlanner.org provides context around the way I learn the best, it runs through a series of questions that ask questions about your learning preferences. The results from this test identified me as someone who is a tactile learner. The results say that in order to improve my overall learning, I need to participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving or drawing, as well as completing art projects, taking walks and acting. In some ways, I believe this to be an accurate representation of myself, however, at times to my detriment. This type of learner is also suggested to take frequent breaks, chew gum and fidget – while these are reasonable tasks for a person to complete, they can become a challenge in the workplace as there is limited opportunity for some of these suggestions. However, it also says that tactile learners are good at remembering tasks that they have physically completed, are coordinated and find reasons to ‘tinker’ around. I believe these to be positive traits, in particular, I think that ‘tinkering’ has led me to understanding many useful skills, from mechanic work to building computers and cooking. This is useful in a workplace as I have an increased ability to work things out when they physically breakdown.  </p>
            
            <p>The final test that I completed was the Enneagram test, I chose to do this test as it was something that my partners workplace had them do as professional development and learning how to work within a team, as her school has a strong team-teaching model as part of its philosophy. The test identified me as an ‘eight’, saying that overall, I am motivated by the desire to be independent and to take charge of myself and others ("The Enneagram Personality Test", 2020). It mentions being assertive and passionate about life, approaching tasks with vigor and confidence. Finally, eights possess the qualities of natural leaders, are action people who prefer to ‘do’ and are happy to make difficult decisions and accept when things go wrong ("The Enneagram Personality Test", 2020). I agree with this, as I often find myself making decisions confidently based on my understanding of the situation, I have no problem with sharing these decisions, and can find it frustrating when others are indecisive.  </p>
            
            <p>Overall, these tests have helped me to understand that I am assertive person who is strong willed and likes to feel appreciated in a group setting. These results help me to understand that in a group setting, I may dominate the conversation or be relied on to make tough calls in difficult situations. Being aware of this means that I am more likely to be able to pick up on it when it is happening and challenge myself to consider the way that others may see this. I also believe that these results make me a good team member, as I am committed, strive to do the best I can and am active in finding a solution, specifically in the practical application of tasks. If I was to form a team for myself, I would need to ensure that each member of the team was able to handle directness and honesty about their work. If I discover that they find this challenging, it would be helpful for me to consider the tone in which I speak. It may also be helpful to pair with an auditory and visual learner, to maximize our potential as each person would bring a new perspective to the group.  </p>
